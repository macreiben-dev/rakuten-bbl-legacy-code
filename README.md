# Description

A legacy codebase that resist a bit testing. First try to run it. 

Then your goal is to make it testable so that you can make changes (FIXME inside) and perhaps refactor it a bit.

This code draws on a C# code kata authored by my distinguished colleague Nicolas Morbieu ; Thanks Nicolas for this ultra realistic kata!
